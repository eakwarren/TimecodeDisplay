## Setup
1. Unzip the latest release to your ~/Documents/Musescore4/Plugins directory.

2. Enable the plugin in MuseScore Studio under Plugins > Manage plugins. Click the plugin and click Enable. Perhaps set a shortcut in Preferences > Shortcuts. (I use Cmd+'.) Load a score and open the plugin with the shortcut or under Plugins.

3. In the Timecode Display window, click the Settings (cog) button. Enter a frame rate. (The ? icon lists example frame rates.) Set an offset if needed. Click the Save button.

In the main window, clicking the Loop button will activate selection duration. To show a duration, select a range in the score.
